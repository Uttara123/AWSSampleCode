These are notes on how you can create a RDS DB in amazon and have a web server talk to it

(1) Create a RDS DB, select MySQL, all defaults. for security group,select to create a new security group

(2) Edit the new security group that was created. The group will have a name 'rds-launch-wizard'

    by default this new security group will have source IP as Custom and your mac or pc's IP.
    edit that and make the source the same security group as the one that will contain your webservers
    tip : type s in the filed and it will show you a list of security groups, select one that is also assigned
    to webservers

(3) Modify the connect.php file in this dir to contain the correct info about your db

    upload this  php file   to a S3 bucket and modify the rds.sh file in this dir to contain the url
    to this php file

(4) rds.sh file contains the Advanced /User Data for your ec2 instance , to set up a web server at launch time

    at the time of instantiation of ec2 instance, add this code to Advanced Data or after ec2 instance is up and
    running, you can execute these statements as root

(5) Now when you got to http://<ip of the instance >/connect.php , you will see that webserver connected to db
