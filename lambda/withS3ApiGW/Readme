This directory contains sample code to set up a web site using AWS S3 and lambda

(1) Defined a bucket in AWS account
    account : Uttara's Personal AWS account
    ut-myserverlesswebsite
    this bucket in Properties Tab is enabled for Static WebSite Hosting,
        with index.html and error.html => these files are in this repo udemy/lambda/withS3ApiGW and also in this S3 bucket
    EndPoint :  http://ut-myserverlesswebsite.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

(2) index.html
    this is rendered when you go to this web site
    the click button invokes a lambda function

(3) Lambda function created in AWS using console, using create from scratch option
    Name : myS3APIGWLambda
    What is important is that in the configuration, Handler must be defined correctly
    When you copy paste the code for python, the file name for handler is index, but you must
    specify the function name exactly as the function name defined in python code
    so my python code was as in file lambdaS3withAPIGW.py
    lambda_handler
    do Handler must be defined as index.lambda_handler
    AWS automatically created a API Gateway for me when I selected API gateway as the trigger
    API Gateway: k47ixwgmhh
    https://k47ixwgmhh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/myS3APIGWLambda
    Used Open option for IAM Role
    Used Simple Microservices Policy for Policy
